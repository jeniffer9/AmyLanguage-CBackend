This is a very important section, you explain to us how you made it work.

\subsection{Theoretical Background}
If you are using theoretical concepts, explain them first in this subsection.
Even if they come from the course (eg. lattices), try to explain the essential
points \emph{in your own words}. Cite any reference work you used like this
\cite{TigerBook}. This should convince us that you know the theory behind what
you coded. 

\subsection{Implementation Details}
%Describe all non-obvious tricks you used. Tell us what you thought was hard and
%why. If it took you time to figure out the solution to a problem, it probably
%means it wasn't easy and you should definitely describe the solution in details
%here. If you used what you think is a cool algorithm for some problem, tell us.
%Do not however spend time describing trivial things (we what a tree traversal
%is, for instance). 
%
%After reading this section, we should be convinced that you knew what you were
%doing when you wrote your extension, and that you put some extra consideration
%for the harder parts.
The hardest part was finding a working and readable substitution for Amy's abstract and case class (which extend the abstract class) functionality.
How can we have "generics" and "inheritance" in C: that seemed like an impossible challenge.
So we contemplated on how to achieve this and sat down and tried to come up with ways
